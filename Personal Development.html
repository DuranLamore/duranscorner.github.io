			<center><p>In my opinion, 3 strengths that I possess are problem solving skills, critical thinking and confidence.<br>
						When talking about my problem solving skills, I would say that they have been developed through difficult situations over the years<br>
						whether it was academical or in my personal life. Through these obstacles I have garnered a respectable skillset in those regards.<br>
						My critical on the otherhand wasn't always something I possesed growing up. As stated before I was in enough problems to be solving them,<br>
						but not always in the best ways. Through my envolvement in sports and having a good grasp on most of my subjects I learned to hone my critical thinking<br>
						which still need improvement and will be improved in the coming years. Finally, I haven't always been a confident person as I wasn't as secure<br>
						of myself as I am now. It was through peer encouragement, self reflection and determination that has given me the standing I have today.</p></center>

			<center><p> In my understanding, the text is trying to instill that goal setting is deciding where you want to go and then designing a plan to get you there.<br>Setting goals that stretch you and make you do things differently is what will lead you to a future that you want.<br>Don’t wait for people to set goals for you.
				We all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. <br>
				The difference is that discipline weighs ounces and regret weights tons. <br>Your best opportunity each day are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on.<br>Don’t just go through the day, get from the day. Don’t spend you time on urgent, spend your time on what is important.<br>
				 We must be our own designer of our lives.<br> So, there are many I can apply these thoughts to my life. I too face the daily strugge<br>
				 of setting goals and wanting to keep striving towards them, I carry the weight of my destiny in my hands and so taking on challenges should be rewarding<br>
				 in the aspect of earning what I long for.
